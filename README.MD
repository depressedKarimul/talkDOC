# talkDOC - AI Doctor Chatbot

## Overview
talkDOC is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide accurate and helpful responses to health-related questions using the Groq language model and real-time web search capabilities via the Serper.dev API. It supports both text-based and voice-based interactions, with voice input/output capabilities and language translation for Bangla and English. The chatbot delivers clear, concise, and user-friendly answers through an interactive terminal interface or a Streamlit web interface.

## Features
- **Health-Focused Responses**: Provides accurate and fact-checked answers to health-related questions using context from web searches.
- **General Query Support**: Answers non-health-related questions with relevant and verified information.
- **Real-Time Web Search**: Utilizes the Serper.dev API to fetch up-to-date information from the top 5 search result snippets.
- **Dual-Model Processing**:
  - Uses `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for generating raw answers.
  - Refines answers with `qwen/qwen3-32b` for improved accuracy, clarity, and structure.
- **Voice Input/Output**: Supports voice-based queries and responses with speech recognition, text-to-speech, and language detection/translation (Bangla and English).
- **Interactive Interfaces**:
  - **Terminal Interface**: Command-line interaction for text-based queries with refined answers.
  - **Streamlit Web Interface**: User-friendly web app for voice and text interactions.
- **Powered by Groq**: Leverages advanced language models for natural language processing.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/depressedKarimul/talkDOC.git
   cd talkDOC
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure the following packages are included in `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   requests
   python-dotenv
   langchain-groq
   langchain-core
   streamlit
   speechrecognition
   pydub
   langdetect
   deep-translator
   gtts
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```
   SERPER_API_KEY=your-serper-api-key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
   ```

## Usage
talkDOC supports two interfaces: a terminal-based chatbot and a Streamlit web app.

### Terminal Interface
1. **Run the Chatbot**:
   ```bash
   python backend.py
   ```
   This starts the text-based interactive terminal interface with refined answers.

2. **Interact with talkDOC**:
   - Type your question (e.g., "What are the symptoms of a cold?").
   - The chatbot fetches relevant context from the top 5 web search snippets, generates a raw answer using `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, and refines it with `qwen/qwen3-32b` for accuracy and clarity.
   - To exit, type `exit` or `quit`.

3. **Example Interaction**:
   ```
   ü§ñ AI Doctor Chatbot (Refined with Google Search + Qwen-3-32B)

   You: What are the symptoms of a cold?
   --- Refined Answer ---
   Common symptoms of a cold include:
   - Runny or stuffy nose
   - Sore throat
   - Cough
   - Sneezing
   - Mild fatigue
   Summary: A cold causes nasal congestion, sore throat, coughing, sneezing, and mild fatigue, usually resolving in a week or two.

   You: exit
   üëã Goodbye!
   ```

### Streamlit Web Interface
1. **Run the Web App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run frontend.py
   ```
   This launches the web interface in your default browser.

2. **Interact with talkDOC**:
   - Record a voice question using the microphone input.
   - Press the **Send** button to process the query.
   - The app detects the language (Bangla or English), translates to English if necessary, queries the AI, and provides a refined response in text and audio.
   - View the transcript of your question and the AI's response on the screen.

3. **Example Interaction**:
   - Record: "What are the symptoms of a cold?" (in English or Bangla).
   - After pressing **Send**, the app displays:
     ```
     üó£Ô∏è You said: What are the symptoms of a cold?
     ü§ñ AI Doctor: Common symptoms of a cold include:
     - Runny or stuffy nose
     - Sore throat
     - Cough
     - Sneezing
     - Mild fatigue
     Summary: A cold causes nasal congestion, sore throat, coughing, sneezing, and mild fatigue, usually resolving in a week or two.
     ```
   - An audio response is played in the detected language.

## Code Structure
